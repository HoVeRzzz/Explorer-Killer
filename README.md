# Explorer-Killer
Explorer-Killer is an open-source script written in python with the simple purpose of providing a quick and effective way to kill and start explorer.exe (file manager application that is included with releases of the Microsoft Windows operating system).

## But what is this for?
   The explorer.exe process is widely known to be a process that uses a high number of **CPU cycles delta**, which can affect your gaming experience, so it is important to kill explorer.exe so that you have an experience smoother and without stuttering. 
   This tool is effective as it facilitates the process of killing/starting the explorer.exe process, not consuming CPU cycles delta.

## Instructions on how to use:


- Install the already compiled executable in the "releases" tab, or download the source code and compile

- Open the executable

- write y to kill explorer.exe (keep explorer.exe dead while you play)

- when you finish playing type n to restart explorer.exe

**(Do not close the program, as it does not cause lag and will ease the process of starting explorer.exe again)**
